Arla Foods: Decarbonization and Mitigation Strategies - Portfolio Summary
Objective
Developed a data-driven strategy to help Arla Foods achieve its goal of 30% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by 2030.
Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) affecting carbon footprint in dairy farms.
Built a scenario-based analysis tool to provide tailored recommendations for individual farms.
Data Processing & Cleaning
Collected and analyzed Climate Check dataset from Arla Foods, containing farm-level emissions data.
Identified key contributors to carbon footprint: Feed inefficiency, Protein efficiency, Land use, Fertilizer application, and Animal mortality.
Preprocessed data: Handled missing values, removed redundant columns, and standardized KPIs.
Segmented farms based on renewable energy and biogas usage for comparative analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation analysis: Measured relationships between KPIs and carbon footprint.
Regression modeling: Quantified the impact of each KPI on emissions reduction.
Farm categorization: Grouped farms based on renewable energy and biogas usage to assess sustainability practices.
Scenario-Based Analysis Tool
Developed an interactive tool that compares a farm’s KPIs with the top 10 farms with the lowest carbon footprint.
Calculated key improvement areas by prioritizing KPIs with the highest impact on emissions.
Predicted carbon footprint reduction based on targeted improvements.
Generated customized action plans to optimize farming practices and reduce emissions.
Key Findings & Business Insights
✅ Primary contributors to high carbon footprint: Feed inefficiency, excessive fertilizer use, and poor land management.
✅ Improving protein efficiency and optimizing feed usage significantly reduces methane emissions.
✅ Farms using renewable electricity and biogas had the lowest carbon footprint compared to those relying on traditional energy sources.
✅ Adopting targeted strategies could help Arla achieve its sustainability goals without increasing production costs.

Data Visualization & Reporting
Bar charts & scatter plots: Showed correlations between KPIs and carbon footprint.
Scenario-based comparison charts: Demonstrated impact of KPI improvements on emissions reduction.
Clustered bar charts: Compared average carbon footprint across different farm categories.
Recommendations & Business Strategy
✔ Adopt precision farming techniques to optimize resource use and reduce inefficiencies.
✔ Encourage biogas and renewable electricity adoption to lower GHG emissions.
✔ Implement a priority-based incentive system to reward farms making the most impactful changes.
✔ Tailor sustainability strategies based on farm-specific data to maximize effectiveness.
